An open letter to the UK and Welsh Governments

Dear Governments,

Wales has the fastest growing digital economy outside London, the number of companies in the tech scene [jumped 9.2% in 2015 and around 3.5% of the total Welsh workforce is involved in IT][1]. 

Britain's recent decision to exit the EU has created huge uncertainty in Wales which now threatens this growth and may even reverse it. Investor confidence in key tech projects and ideas has suffered. The sector as a whole is at risk of loss of income and jobs outright.

Wales has fantastic conditions for the growth of Welsh tech companies. We have a low cost base for startups, with affordable talent. We have excellent universities that are disrupting technology globally. We expect, with the correct support, to be contributing to the UK economy, not taking from it.

We must act to restore confidence in our sector through strong policy as set out below, with set dates and milestones that the sector can rally around.

- Non-punative access to the single market with free movement of people involved in the tech industry bringing the top talent in those fields into Wales
- Wales specific VAT and tax initiatives that target globally innovative and disruptive technologies
- A specific provision of funds for growth of tech in Wales, specifically for the growth of the Welsh tech economy until 2030
- A move away from 'jobs created' to 'wages improved' as a metric of funding success 

The ‘jobs created’ metric has damaged the growth of small, risky businesses like small enterprising technology firms. It favours larger established enterprises like call centres, with higher volume, lower paid jobs. Higher wages for everyone in Wales across the board will help alleviate lots of the social issues that we face. It will also attract more of the international top talent we need to grow our tech economy.

Policymakers have identified the digital economy as one of the [UK's key economic strengths][2]. This set of policies will allow us to continue as one of the fastest growing tech sectors in Europe. 

Against all our poor recent economic history, we are flourishing. With your support, we can become the nation of overachievers that our sportswomen and sportsmen consistently show us to be.

The Welsh Tech sector
