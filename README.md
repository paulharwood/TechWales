An open letter to the UK and Welsh Governments

Dear Governments,

As a nation, Wales has been working against adversity for decades. We have a modest economy, a small populace, below-par infrastructure and a lack of key industry. Against all these odds, we succeed and flourish. We are a nation of overachievers.

Our economy is now vulnerable in these times of uncertainty. This affects our outlook and prosperity as a nation. In thirty years, we still haven't found an economic replacement for the coal industry. We need an industry to replace the financial hole that coal has left.
 
The export of coal provided wealth, security and prosperity for all Wales' citizens over the last century. Our nation is hungry for wealth and prosperity again. 

The tech sector has a chance be that industry. It can become *the* export industry, for Wales, as valuable to the nation as coal was. An industry that is crucial for future generations.

We are about to lose gains in prosperity through tech. Wales has some of the lowest per capita wages in Europe. We also have areas of extreme poverty with little prospects. We fear the region will suffer more than any other in the UK.

The major natural resource we have to exploit in Wales is the talent of our people. The emergence and rapid growth of the tech economy in Wales is a new dawn for citizens, a hope. It offers international opportunities to grow national businesses and build a critical export economy. 

The tech community stands to lose as much as every other industry following the EU referendum result. But, unlike other industries we may lose our current advantage forever. Global markets move fast in tech, it is easy to lose any advantage you currently have.

Our country has enjoyed an annual net benefit of £245m from the EU. Despite this, 52.5 per cent of Welsh referendum voters backed leaving the EU. Wales now has an anti-europe tag. This does not reflect the feeling of the majority of the tech community in Wales, who voted to remain.

The Prime Minister won't guarantee any EU funds that are currently committed to Wales. Funding losses, alongside access to the single market will have immediate and disastrous consequences. 

Already, the referendum  result  has  had  a negative impact in the tech industry.  Investment in key tech projects and ideas  has halted, because of uncertainty.  The sector as a whole is at risk of loss of income and jobs outright.

We must act to restore that investor confidence in our sector through strong policy and a clear plan. We need clear milestones and dates that the industry can rally around.

We have fantastic conditions for the growth of Welsh tech companies. We have a  low cost base for startups, with affordable talent. We have excellent universities that are disrupting technology globally. We expect, with the correct support, to be contributing to the UK economy, not taking from it.

We want to see the following policies implemented immediately:

1. **Business and tax incentives for all tech firms**
From startup to multinational, our tech firms need direct access to all EU marketplaces to compete, without any penalty such as a tariff or levy. We absolutely require access to the single market with free movement of people involved in the tech industry, along with specific VAT and tax initiatives that target globally innovative and disruptive technologies, bringing the top talent in those fields into Wales.

2. **Like for like Protection of EU funding**
Create a temporary tech body that works with existing EU fund partners. It’s responsibility will be to properly wind down EU funded opportunities that have been created in the Welsh tech sector. It should have a ring fenced budget to draw down on should any shortfall occur and remove uncertainty for those projects and outputs. 

3. **A provision of funds for growth of tech in Wales**
Specifically for the growth of the Welsh tech economy until 2030. A significant contribution from the UK Government to supporting the growth of the Tech scene in Wales, in line with the spending projections made by analysis of EU spending.

4. **A move away from ‘jobs created’ as a metric of economic success**
Wales has some of the poorest economic areas in Europe, with depressed wages and low expendable incomes. The ‘jobs created’ metric has suppressed wages, hampering growth of small, risky businesses - like small enterprising technology firms. It favours larger established enterprises with higher volume, lower paid jobs.
A policy implementation of "Wages created" as a metric of funding success is critical. Whilst unemployment is an issue it is not as big an issue as the lack of disposable income our economy has to help grow other businesses. Higher wages in Wales across the board will help alleviate lots of the social issues that we face. It will also attract more of the international top talent we need to grow our tech economy.

5. **Protecting tech innovation as a way of life**
A revision of the social contract is desperately needed. As technology firms disrupt markets they are incentivised to automate production, which leads to unemployment. This is a global technology pressure, not a local one and one that must be addressed by revising the social contract in Wales.
This policy will act as a beacon to a world that is trying embrace innovation as a way of life. To this end we need a strong policy lead that will support the re-education of people who risk losing their jobs in the face of technology progress. The policy should favour supported entrepreneurship over formal learning, in sectors that involve the re-use of skill sets as a route away from jobs that are under threat. Individuals should be financially incentivised to be early adopters of new and emerging technology trends in order to keep Wales at a cutting edge in the sectors affected.

This set of policies will allow us to continue growing at the rate we are, one of the fastest growing tech sectors in Europe.
