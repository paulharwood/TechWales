# An open letter to the UK and Welsh Governments from the Welsh tech startup community

Dear Governments,

Wales has a huge amount of potential as a world force in starting companies, because the talent, passion, commitment and drive of the people working in the sector is formidable.

The sector includes start up and early stage companies, tech entrepreneurs, programmers, designers, marketing specialists, consultants and educators. That is not to mention the host of other supporting specialisms like cyber security, software engineering and small scale manufacturing.

Most of the growth in the tech sector in Wales over the last 4-5 years has been partly responsible or made possible by EU funded projects.
