An open letter to the UK and Welsh Governments

Dear Governments,

As a nation, Wales has been working against adversity for decades. Systematically gutted of our key industries by outside parties and woefully underfunded to create new ones, we are currently a net burden on the EU to the tune of £245 million. But it does not have to be like this.

The export of coal provided security and prosperity for all Wales' citizens over the last century. Our nation is hungry for that prosperity again. In thirty years, we still haven't found an economic replacement for the coal industry. We need an industry to close the financial wound that the breaking of our coal mines left.

We believe, that the tech sector has a chance be the catalyst that turns Wales into a net contributor. An export industry as valuable to this nation as the coal we once dug up from the darkness and sailed to the horizons was.

The arguments for Wales developing a stronger technology are many and compelling. Low wages, high levels of graduates, strong university research, low costs of living, high quality of life. The arguments against are not insurmountable. Infrastructure, risk investment, economy. Yet we find ourselves in a position where all that we as a sector, have worked, sweated and wept over, may be swept asside by the views of the masses.

The tech community stands to lose as much as every other industry following the EU referendum result. But, unlike other industries we may lose our current advantage forever. Global markets move fast in tech, it is easy to lose any advantage you currently have.

Yes. We know. Our country has enjoyed an annual net benefit of £245m from the EU. Despite this, 52.5 per cent of Welsh referendum voters backed leaving the EU. Wales now has an anti-europe tag. This does not reflect the feeling of the majority of the tech community in Wales, who voted to remain.

In these times of uncertainty, our technology economy becomes vulnerable. Wales has some of the lowest per capita wages in Europe. We also have areas of extreme poverty with little prospects. We fear the region will suffer more than any other in the UK.

The major natural resource we have to exploit in Wales is the talent of our people. The emergence and rapid growth of the tech economy in Wales is a new dawn for citizens, a hope. It offers international opportunities to grow national businesses and build a critical export economy.

The Prime Minister won't guarantee any EU funds that are currently committed to Wales. Funding losses, alongside access to the single market will have immediate and disastrous consequences.

Already, the referendum result has had a negative impact in the tech industry. Investment in key tech projects and ideas has halted. The sector as a whole is at risk of loss of income and jobs outright.

We must act to restore that investor confidence in our sector through strong policy and a clear plan. We need clear milestones and dates that the industry can rally around and we challenge you, our elected representatives, to show the leadership required to steer us through this uncertainty.

To support this venture, we would humbly suggest a simple, clear set of policies that clearly demonstrate that our governments commitment to the Technology sector in Wales, is as strong as it's potential growth:

Non-punative access to the single market From startup to multinational, our tech firms need direct access to all EU marketplaces to compete, without any penalty such as a tariff or levy. We absolutely require access to the single market with free movement of people involved in the tech industry, along with specific VAT and tax initiatives that target globally innovative and disruptive technologies, bringing the top talent in those fields into Wales.

Like for like Protection of EU funding Create a temporary tech body that works with existing EU fund partners. It’s responsibility will be to properly wind down EU funded opportunities that have been created in the Welsh tech sector. It should have a ring fenced budget to draw down on should any shortfall occur and remove uncertainty for those projects and outputs.

A provision of funds for growth of tech in Wales Specifically for the growth of the Welsh tech economy until 2030. A significant contribution from the UK Government to supporting the growth of the Tech scene in Wales, in line with the spending projections made by analysis of EU spending. Currently, even UKTI are under-investing in our region.

A move away from ‘jobs created’ as a metric of economic success Wales has some of the poorest economic areas in Europe, with depressed wages and low expendable incomes. The ‘jobs created’ metric has suppressed wages, hampering growth of small, risky businesses - like small enterprising technology firms. It favours larger established enterprises with higher volume, lower paid jobs. A policy implementation of "Wages created" as a metric of funding success is critical. Whilst unemployment is an issue it is not as big an issue as the lack of disposable income our economy has to help grow other businesses. Higher wages in Wales across the board will help alleviate lots of the social issues that we face. It will also attract more of the international top talent we need to grow our tech economy.

Protecting tech innovation as a way of life A revision of the social contract is desperately needed. As technology firms disrupt markets they are incentivised to automate production, which leads to unemployment. This is a global technology pressure, not a local one and one that must be addressed by revising the social contract in Wales. This policy will act as a beacon to a world that is trying embrace innovation as a way of life. To this end we need a strong policy lead that will support the re-education of people who risk losing their jobs in the face of technology progress. The policy should favour supported entrepreneurship over formal learning, in sectors that involve the re-use of skill sets as a route away from jobs that are under threat. Individuals should be financially incentivised to be early adopters of new and emerging technology trends in order to keep Wales at a cutting edge in the sectors affected.

We have fantastic conditions for the growth of Welsh tech companies. We have a low cost base for startups, with affordable talent. We have excellent universities that are disrupting technology globally. We expect, with the correct support, to be contributing to the UK economy, not taking from it.

This set of policies will allow us to continue as one of the fastest growing tech sectors in Europe. Against all our poor recent history, we are flourishing. With your support, we can become the nation of overachievers that our sportsmen consistently show us to be.

The Welsh Tech sector
