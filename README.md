# (DRAFT) Creating a tech friendly Wales in the light of the EU referendum

## An open letter to the UK and Welsh Governments

Dear Governments,

Wales is a nation of overachievers and has been working hard against it’s own economic odds of a small populace, poor infrastructure and lack of key industry for many, many years. It has struggled to find a replacement for the coal industry that fuelled so much wealth in the country, along with prosperity for nearly all of it’s citizens over the last century.

We are still seeing the effects of the removal of our main industry over thirty years later, as we have some of the lowest per capita wages in Europe and now stand to lose even more wealth and prosperity than other areas because of Britain’s exit from the EU. 

It is because of these facts that we must move quickly to consolidate the opportunity technology has presented to our economy in Wales.

We fully understand the irony of 52.5 per cent of Welsh voters backed leaving the EU during the referendum last week, despite the region enjoying an annual net benefit of £245m from the UK's membership and open access to the single market. This has led to the unfortunate position of giving Wales an anti-europe tag, which is not the feeling of most if not all of the tech community in Wales.

We feel that the emergence and rapid growth of the tech economy in Wales is a new dawn for citizens here, offering international opportunities to grow businesses and build a valuable export economy. The major natural resource we have to exploit in Wales outside the beauty of our countryside is the talent of our people.

The tech community in Wales stands to lose as much as every other industry, but unlike other industries we may lose our current advantage forever as global markets move quickly to adapt to the new opportunities that technology brings.

Our current Prime Minister has declined to guarantee the funds that are currently committed to Wales via the EU, which would absolutely reduce our opportunity to grow into a self sufficient nation through tech. 

When EU funds that are currently contributing to both in startup business and academic sectors are removed along with access to the single market, this will have immediate and disastrous consequences for emerging companies that either: a) receive support or existing companies or b) require further funding for access to top local and international talent. Lots will go bust immediately, some will shrink immediately, leading to the overall shrinking of the sector and the loss of income and jobs outright.

We are already seeing the negative effects of the UK's exit of the EU with reduced investment opportunities and investors backing out of existing deals. If we are to remedy this we must act very quickly to restore that investor confidence in our sector through strong policy and a clear plan with clear milestones and dates that the industry can rally around.

We are a proud nation with hard working and entrepreneurial people, and want to grow the tech economy form the £1bn industry it currently is, to be the biggest industry and biggest employer in Wales and a credible force on the world stage. We have fantastic conditions for growth of Welsh based tech companies, such as a low cost base for startups and excellent universities that are disrupting technology globally. We expect, with the correct support, to be contributing to the UK economy, not taking from it.

We would like to see the following policies implemented by either or both governments immediately:

1. Like for like Protection of the EU funding streams that are committed until 2020
Create a temporary Welsh governmental tech body that works with the EU funding partners to properly wind down opportunities that have been created in the tech sector in Wales through access to the EU funds, with a budget to draw down on should any shortfall occur and remove uncertainty for those projects and outputs. This can be paid for with the savings made from 2018 onwards with no payment being made into the EU as a consequence of withdrawal.

2. A provision of funds specifically for the growth of the Welsh tech economy until 2030
A significant contribution from the UK Government to supporting the growth of the Tech scene in Wales, in line with the spending projections made by analysis of EU spending.

3. A move away from ‘jobs created’ as a metric of economic success, to ‘wages increased’ 
Wales has some of the poorest economic areas in Europe, with depressed wages and low expendable incomes.
This metric has always hampered growth of small, risky businesses like small enterprising technology firms and favoured larger enterprises who are able to claim greater successes because of increased budgets. A policy implementation of “average wage per job” as a metric of funding success is critical. Whilst unemployment is an issue it is not as big an issue as the lack of disposable income our economy has to help grow other businesses. Higher wages in Wales across the board will help alleviate lots of the social issues that we face and will attract more of the international top talent we need to grow our tech economy.

4. A revision of the social contract protecting innovation as a way of life
As technology firms disrupt markets they are incentivised to automate production, leading to unemployment. This is a global technology pressure, not a local one and one that must be addressed by revising the social contract in Wales, as a beacon to the world in innovative ways to improve life experiences and chances and long term security for families and individuals. 
To this end we need a strong policy lead that will support the fast re-eduction of people who risk losing their jobs in the face of technology progress. The policy should favour supported entrepreneurship over formal learning, in sectors that involve the re-use of skill sets as a route away from jobs that are under threat. Individuals should be incentivised to be early adopters of new and emerging technology trends in order to keep Wales at a cutting edge in the sectors affected.

5. Business and tax incentives for all tech firms, from startup to multinational
To compete, our tech firms need direct access to all EU marketplaces, without any penalty such as a tariff or levy. We absolutely require access to the single market with free movement of people involved in the tech industry, along with specific VAT and tax initiatives that target globally innovative and disruptive technologies, bringing the top talent in those fields into Wales.

This set of policies will allow us to continue growing at the rate we are, one of the fastest growing tech sectors in Europe.
